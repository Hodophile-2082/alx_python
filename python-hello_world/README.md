This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program.
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line
 
 3_last digit
